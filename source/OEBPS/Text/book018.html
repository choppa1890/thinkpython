  <p class="calibre15"><a class="calibre16" id="@default1491"></a></p>

  <p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Python is an <b class="calibre19">object-oriented programming language</b>, which means that it provides features that support object-oriented programming.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">It is not easy to define object-oriented programming, but we have already seen some of its characteristics:</span></p>

  <ul class="calibre6">
    <li class="li-itemize"><span class="calibre4">Programs are made up of object definitions and function definitions, and most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on objects.</span></li>

    <li class="li-itemize"><span class="calibre4">Each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world, and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">For example, the <tt class="calibre7">Time</tt> class defined in Chapter&nbsp;</span><a class="calibre3" href="../Text/book017.html#time"><span class="calibre4">16</span></a> <span class="calibre4">corresponds to the way people record the time of day, and the functions we defined correspond to the kinds of things people do with times. Similarly, the <tt class="calibre7">Point</tt> and <tt class="calibre7">Rectangle</tt> classes correspond to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">So far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to support object-oriented programming. These features are not strictly necessary; most of them provide alternative syntax for things we have already done. But in many cases, the alternative is more concise and more accurately conveys the structure of the program.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">For example, in the <tt class="calibre7">Time</tt> program, there is no obvious connection between the class definition and the function definitions that follow. With some examination, it is apparent that every function takes at least one <tt class="calibre7">Time</tt> object as an argument.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre15"><a class="calibre16" id="@default1492"></a> <a class="calibre16" id="@default1493"></a></p>

  <p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">This observation is the motivation for <b class="calibre19">methods</b>; a method is a function that is associated with a particular class. We have seen methods for strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples. In this chapter, we will define methods for user-defined types.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre15"><a class="calibre16" id="@default1494"></a> <a class="calibre16" id="@default1495"></a></p>

  <p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">Methods are semantically the same as functions, but there are two syntactic differences:</span></p>

  <ul class="calibre6">
    <li class="li-itemize"><span class="calibre4">Methods are defined inside a class definition in order to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit.</span></li>

    <li class="li-itemize"><span class="calibre4">The syntax for invoking a method is different from the syntax for calling a function.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="calibre15"><span class="calibre4">In the next few sections, we will take the functions from the previous two chapters and transform them into methods. This transformation is purely mechanical; you can do it simply by following a sequence of steps. If you are comfortable converting from one form to another, you will be able to choose the best form for whatever you are doing.</span></p>
