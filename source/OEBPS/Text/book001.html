  <h2 class="section sigilNotInTOC" id="heading_id_3"><a class="calibre14" id="toc1"></a>The strange history of this book</h2>

  <p class="calibre15">In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</p>

  <p class="calibre15">One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.</p>

  <p class="calibre15">Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:</p>

  <ul class="calibre6">
    <li class="li-itemize">Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.</li>

    <li class="li-itemize">Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define each term at first use.</li>

    <li class="li-itemize">Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps.</li>

    <li class="li-itemize">Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="calibre15">I needed a title, so on a whim I chose <em class="calibre9">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>.</p>

  <p class="calibre15">My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice.</p>

  <p class="calibre15">I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.</p>

  <p class="calibre15"><a class="calibre16" id="@default0"></a> <a class="calibre16" id="@default1"></a></p>

  <p class="calibre15">What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book.</p>

  <p class="calibre15">Jeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by Chris Meyers, and in 2001 we released <em class="calibre9">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python</em>, also under the GNU Free Documentation License. As Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling hard copies through Amazon.com and college book stores. Other books from Green Tea Press are available at <tt class="calibre7">greenteapress.com</tt>.</p>

  <p class="calibre15">In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.</p>

  <p class="calibre15">Over the last five years I have continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises. In 2008 I started work on a major revision&mdash;at the same time, I was contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press who was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!</p>

  <p class="calibre15">The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title <em class="calibre9">Think Python</em>. Some of the changes are:</p>

  <ul class="calibre6">
    <li class="li-itemize">I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present general techniques for finding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pitfalls.</li>

    <li class="li-itemize">I removed the material in the last few chapters about the implementation of lists and trees. I still love those topics, but I thought they were incongruent with the rest of the book.</li>

    <li class="li-itemize">I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial projects.</li>

    <li class="li-itemize">I added a series of case studies&mdash;longer examples with exercises, solutions, and discussion. Some of them are based on Swampy, a suite of Python programs I wrote for use in my classes. Swampy, code examples, and some solutions are available from <tt class="calibre7">thinkpython.com</tt>.</li>

    <li class="li-itemize">I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns.</li>

    <li class="li-itemize">The use of Python is more idiomatic. The book is still about programming, not Python, but now I think the book gets more leverage from the language.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="calibre15">I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.</p>
